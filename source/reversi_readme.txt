This was a reasonably challenging assignment but also very satisfying. There
were lots of meaty problems with edge cases that needed to be handled. 
Working at such a low level was frustrating at first after working with higher
level languages with vast built in libraries. After a while, however, you shift
modes and start to see the C patterns and idioms a bit more clearly.

I went to a lot of trouble to stop myself from modifying the functions and 
parameters that were provided in the startup code. No doubt some of them were
written that way to force people down paths to prove competence.
