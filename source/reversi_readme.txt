This was a challenging assignment but also very satisfying. There were lots of 
meaty problems with edge cases that needed to be handled. I found the startup 
code to perhaps guide me to a program structure that I probably wouldn't have 
done myself if starting from a blank page. That being said, I tried to respect
the style of the structures and functions and reflect them in my implementation.

Overall I am happy with the implementation. It's not perfect, but no software
ever is. Parts I would focus on improving are:

* I don't like the duplication of code in the initialisation of players i.e. 
init player one and then just do the same thing to player two.
* Handling input strings, newlines and Ctrl+D (EOF) was hard. I'm confident it 
works, but it is certainly not elegant.
